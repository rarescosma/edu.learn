/**
 * This problem is the same as the previous but introduces the concept of modules.
 * You will need to create two files to solve this.
 *
 * Create a program that prints a list of files in a given directory, filtered by the extension of the files.
 * The first argument is the directory name and the second argument is the extension filter.
 * Print the list of files (one file per line) to the console. You must use asynchronous I/O.
 *
 * You must write a module file to do most of the work.
 * The module must export a single function that takes three arguments: the directory name, the filename extension string and a callback function.
 *
 * The filename extension argument must be the same as was passed to your program.
 * i.e. don't turn it in to a RegExp or prefix with "." or do anything else
 * but pass it to your module where you can do what you need to make your filter work.
 *
 * The callback function must be called using the idiomatic node(err, data) convention.
 * This convention stipulates that unless there's an error, the first argument passed to the callback will be null, and the second will be your data.
 * In this case the data will be your filtered list of files, as an Array.
 * If you receive an error, e.g. from your call to  fs.readdir(), the callback must be called with the error,
 * and ***only the error***, as the first argument.
 *
 * You must not print directly to the console from your module file, only from your original program.
 *
 * In the case of an error bubbling up to your original program file, simply check for it and print an informative message to the console.
